# Interactive Media  

Recent key years of Internet development as a mainstream practice has led to it being a popular media and communication form. The World Wide Web has now not only been absorbed into the texture of our everyday lives but it has become a pivotal tool for movements such as neoliberalism or what is also known as liberal ideology.  In Lisa Nakamura's Digitizing Race, they examine and is a response to how "interactive media ask us to identify with someone elseâ€™s mental structure" stated by Lev Manovich. It is undeniable that an enormous factor to this cycle of media consumption involves this self production of our Internet personality and identity. Nakamura comments on how visuals images are a currency and therefore contributes to this digital presentation of race almost. This is done through communication and dialogue of users. 
  
In our contemporary period, influential apps like Tik Tok play a major role in our modern methods of communication. The app's features such as regular posts, lives, explore or FYP page,  and the follow, like, and QR scanning buttons are a few interactive functions to name where racial components are involved. Recent circulation follows this (can be very much proven) theory that the app favors people of a lighter skin tone. This was brought up when users started quickly noticing how on their FYP page were mostly generating users that were lighter in color. Earlier stages of this theory had people bringing up the fact that the company behind Tik Tok were Chinese, hence, them not being as progressive and less guidelines or strictness being reinforced by the country. However, it appear that this is no longer a problem after backlash. The platform has continuously failed people of color as it gets to ultimately decide who deserves to gain popularity. Various users have criticised the platform for not heavily monitoring some of the entremely racist and problematic videos that were surfacing on there. The only actions taken were by users themselves after backlash from viewers or after experiencing the consequences of college or work expulsion. The main recognized users, who are now practically C-list celebrities, also contribute to this problem. Charli D'amelio's case makes a great example as she is now (and has been for a while) the most followed user on the platform. Critics were arguing whether she truly deserved her fame as the dance she got popular for was discovered to have not been hers originally and was created by a black content creator. Although since the discovery she has credited her and has done the dance with her multiple times as somewhat of an act of "kindness", the original creator is not receiving what Charli is getting. She is not getting paid in money and there is barely any recognition while Charli on the other hand is getting sponsorships left and right and has luxury house, Prada, endorsements along with her sister now being in the spotlight getting luxury house, Chanel, endorsements. A look at social media platforms such as Tik Tok raises questions and interest as to how the element of race can affect what users consume.
