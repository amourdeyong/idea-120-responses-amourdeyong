Jared's notes:
Love the spartan/iconic sound of this! Sounds truly bizarre and quite intuitive. I think you could do all of these things in Premiere; if you find GIFs that do some of the things you want (rotating pizzas, or other animated fruits) you are welcome to use those and collage them together in Premiere. Go back and look at our Premiere workshop (https://vimeo.com/466053325/2d5c5ee0ab) which shows how to move video and images around in the sequence. There doesn't have to be any, but this makes me curious if there is any interaction between you and these items? Is there a performance going back and forth or reacting with them? Keep in mind since this is a zoom background, no sound will be heard (but you can put sound in and just upload the video to youtube later if you want it to be heard).

Let me know if you have questions!
