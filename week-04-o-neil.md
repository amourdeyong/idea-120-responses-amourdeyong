# Weapons of Mass Destruction  

In "Weapons of Mass Destruction", the author Cathy O'neil begins by introducing the term "WMD" which stands for, what the title implies, Weapons of Mass
Destruction. O'neil gives context for and further explains WMD throughout the book. As she ended the Introduction with "Welcome to the dark side of big data.",
she then began to essentially highlight how our technological advancements have allowed us to proceed into and embrace this new world of algorithms and big
data with complications that our society are unaware of. 
  
In the fifth chapter, O'neil acknowledges and questions the methods our own government uses. She mentions the various crime predition software that we have
been relying on across the country. Most of them consist of the same formula which often involves the program processing and calculating historical crime data
and the ones by the hour, filtering out locations for places where crimes are the most likely to occur. Despite the technical complexity of these systems, they
remain to to be the "trusted" sources for police stations and officers for detecting crime. However, the casual acceptance of these criminal seeking techniques
raises problems and concerns for communities are majority minorities and low income families.
  
This form of "hot spot policing" has recently been heavily emphasized and brought to light as the BLM movement has gotten more attention than ever with the
protests that started at the beginning of June. With techniques like such still prevalent and utilized, it not only puts marginalized groups at a computerized
risk but it enhances prejudice as it brings the racial factor into the conversation. These systems have algorithms that send police to hot spots that tend to be
the hood for usually petty crimes because the program reads it as a bigger threat since there's usually a larger concentration of people there. This ultimately
results in these areas getting placed into a loop of surveillance because more police will get sent there ending in the program reading it as a more dangerous
territory. With the area or region getting lebelled a certain way only lead to prejudice, which is often demonstrated through the treatment during arrests.
Hopefully with the increase in awareness for police brutality and the BLM movement, as a society we can alse demand for change such as altering and improving
softwares such as the ones that are currently being used within the system. It is absolutely necessary that we educate ourselves to know better than to rely on
certain written algorithms as, in this case, it can risk and ruin the lives of many people and their families.
