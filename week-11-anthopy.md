# Anthopy Response

Questions:
- At what point does the interaction between two rules generate the opposite of an interesting and volatile dynamic?
- Do majority of the creators decide which variables to include when contructing their games in order to maximize how dynamic it becomes based on the targeted players or is it based on their own preferences?
- Are the games that lack dynamics, relationships, and systems automatically "failures"?

In response to the question regarding "At what point does the interaction between two rules generate the opposite of an interesting and volatile dynamic?", it 
appears that if the variables involved lack the following: dynamics, relationships, or systems, that is when the interaction creates a rather strained, uncomfortable, or even boring experience for the players. The set of rules essentially create the environment for the players and whether how successful or effective they are in making things as interactive and engaging as possible.

In the text, the writer, Anna Anthopy, uses the folk game, Tag, as a prototype. The game, Tag, "works" and because its rules for the basic or most common version 
has an IT player and the goals for that position includes having to "tag" or touch as many players as possible with players being safe from the person that is IT 
when they are in contact with a tree. Those rules not only guide the greation of the situation but also allow for players to have an exciting and interactive 
experience by setting them in opposition to each other, giving most of the players a goal and the other player a reason to intervene causing a tense scenario. 

Depending on the location and the players, the rules often get switched up or modified. However, the game still works in that the same set of rules remain, leaving 
the same dynamic for the players. Obviously if the rules are tweaked or altered to a point that results in the players no longer feeling the same type of 
excitement, the game no longer works which answers the question of when will the rules begin to create the opposite effect of an interesting dynamic.
