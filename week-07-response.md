# Chalabi, O'neil, Gayomali: Response  

In "3 ways to spot a bad statistic", Chalabi encourages the audience to be skeptical of modern statistics. Through her previous experience working in the statistical department of the U.N. and being a data journalist, she educates the audience by telling them the three factors she considers before determining whether the data shown is indeed reliable and they involve: the rate of uncertainty, audience's ability to envision themselves in the data, and how the data is accumulated. She also highlighted that, "Private companies don't have a huge interest in getting the numbers right, they just need the right numbers." From today's standard of operation, most private companies' main responsibility lies in fixating on the realms of sales and profit and whatever that can benefit or concern them financially rather than paying attention and prioritizing what might happen to their consumers which is highly problematic.

Through their writing, it is evident that O'neil recognizes how pivotal targeted advertising is. O'neil simply describes the process as corporations retrieving personal data from online users and allowing companies to gain the ability to learn about them in great detail. By enabling companies to do so, ads sometimes --almost as if magically, appear at the right time and place to convince people to make purchases since patterns are recorded. Whilst the justification for these personalized ads stem from industries apparently wanting to "get to know the consumers better by customizing the presented ads, it is, however, extremely predatory in that it preys on consumers in a capitalistic sense. Some can argue that they resemble credit card loan companies. This illustrates that available marketing tactics such as these are inappropriate as they not only frequently act as an envasion of privacy going unnoticed but they also showcase how truly corrupt many big corporations are in sometimes attempting to target people's attention during their vulnerable state.

Although the title is pretty self-exaplanatory, in "How typeface influences the way we read and think", Gayomali emphasizes that typography acts as a crucial ingredient in what can be described as a complex presentation. The writer cites an example through a research study that was conducted by Errol Morris from The New York Times. The participants involved were online readers of the publication. Upon completion of this regular article about a scientific study, their role was to respond to a designed quiz that questioned the legitimacy of the study's conclusions. After evaluating the responses, the results yielded that the typeface, Bakerville, proved to be more believable. Through this example, it demonstrates how the visual element of a typeface alters the perception in how a certain body of text comes across. With this in mind, writers can now utilize the significance of typeface design to their advantage as they now have an extra variable to consider when presenting their text among the other writing content that are accessible online. This leads to the potential argument that the existence of various fonts have changed the world of writing.
