# the art of Gesamtkunstwerk  
<p>
In Entangled, Chris Salter reviews the influence modern techniologies of electricity and mechanics has had on  
artistic performance practices in the twentieth and twenty-first century. Salter dissects the rich history of  
performance experimentation through theater, music, architecture, and design, are a few fields to name. Salter  
does so while remaining mindful of the alterations of the political, social, and economic circumstances through-  
out time. In the piece, the term Gesamtkunstwerk gets introduced. Gesamtkunstwerk, essentially, foreshadowed  
the modern practice of multimedia. Practitioners of this practice adopt this interdisciplinary approach of  
continuously learning new crafts, printing technologies, industrial processes, and artistic techniques resulting  
in artists expanding their skills to all aspects of designs.

In terms of digital contemporary tools, many creators online use different applications depending on their  
form of media. For most video creators, softwares like imovie, Final Cut Pro, and Adobe Premiere Pro CC are often  
used. These applications allow them to alter and manipulate the tone, lighting, audio, etc through footages, music,  
sounds, and much more to their liking. As for what is known as "influencers", programs like Adobe Photoshop,  
Facetune, and other mobile applications are frequently mentioned tools. Although no video clips are involved, there  
are visuals, usually images, that get modifications. These modifications create illusions. Music or sounds can also  
be involved, depending on the creator's preference. The media that receives adjustments would be considered  
Gesamtkunstwerk as different forms of art such as videos, music, sounds, photos, and possibly theatrics is included.

Regarding physical contemporary tools, the camera comes is what comes to mind as it is often used. Modern  
technological advancements have allowed the camera to not only capture a still shot but to record footages and pick  
up audio as well. The way the camera gets utilized not only depends on the artist's intention and objective but  
also the type of camera. Over the years, an enormous amount of cameras have been released with different ones for  
different purposes. For an example, coming back into style for the youth is the aesthetic of old film photos so  
film cameras are currently trending. Compositions that generated from a camera would be considered Gesamtkunstwerk  
as multiple forms of art such as the ones listed previously (for digital tools) play a part.

Skimming through works in the Rhizome Anthology, 'LOVE' and 'Mouchette' are pieces that would qualify as a  
Gesamtkunstwerk. In 'Love' a series of seven stories are arranged in a navigable grid of HTML files. Media such as  
artistic play, images, text, and interactive compositions play a role in mapping a range of experiences associated  
with romantic love for the audience. In comparison, 'Mouchette', is an ever-growing site that takes advantage of  
expressive HTML elements in order to incorporate the viewer's participation into the emotional world of an  
adolescent girl. Both of the works mentioned qualify as a Gesamtkunstwerk as they not only include multiple forms of  
media but also requests for viewer participation which is influenced by Gesamtkunstwerk as it encourages artists to  
collaborate.
