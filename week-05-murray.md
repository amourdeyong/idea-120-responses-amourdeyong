# Murray's Predictions & Hyper-realistic Evironments  
After reading "Digital TV and the Emerging Formats of Cyber-drama", it is evident that Murray's predictions about internet television and inhabiting virtual environments were successful. The entertainment industry utilizes the more recent consumer switch with the digital medium. Entertainment consumers now rely on devices such as phones, laptops, and such as the new generations in society have now adapted to the technological advancements. As mentioned by Murray, it seems like the entertainment industry will continue to remain conservative in terms of the creation of digital products. A simple glance on the internet while searching for content will allow the regular user to come across the fact that entertainment companies have now transferred their content like television series and award shows to being accessible online on streaming sites and social networks. As an example, instead of waiting for a certain award show to play on TV, there is the show readily now avaliable to be streamed live on sites such as Youtube without having to sit through commercials upon commercials and there's the option to participate in what is playing without being restricted to the vicinity of your home. The modifications, if anything, only target the familiar formats of film and television to create a somehow more interactive experienve for the viewers. Murray's prediction is reflected in the hyper-realistic virtual environments the actors of 'The Mandalorian' inhabited while acting. The prediction aligns in that three-dimensional environments have now become standardized. As seen in the video, sets now rely on a more virtual production with artists can now use modern program softwares to create photorealistic 3D backgrounds that allows a more realistic perspective by following the camera's field of view. This is all due to motion tracked cameras allowing directors the ability to execute traditional cinematographic techniques within the virtual set. The difference in 'reality' between the actors and the viewers experience in the production lies in that LED lit sets give the people who act the opportunity to act in what seems to be the environment the characters should be embedded in while viewers get to see a constructed reality with more lifelike and convincing materials as technological innovations create a less limited environment so a simple background shift won't destroy the illusion.
