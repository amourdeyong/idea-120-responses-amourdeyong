# Response to Rise of the Videogame Zinesters  

Throughout the years, our society has been able to witness an increase in demand for video games which has led to many spectators to creat this new found 
fear, ultimately leading to questions and various conspiracy theories. This is mainly on account of the limited perspective video games have offered up to 
this point. With a rise in the video game market, recently there has also been easier accessibility to gaming and coding. With this in mind, there is a 
positive correlation with improving video games as those two factors make up video games.
  
With a larger quantity of voices participating in the creation of games, we can finally lift the negative connotation involved and establish video games as 
the art form it is. Games, digital and otherwise, transmit ideas and culture which can be share with other medias such as theater, physical games, films, 
poeams, novels, music albums, the list goes on. As an example, a painting has the ability to display the experiences of the subject as an image. A game on a 
similar note is able to convey the experiences of the subject as a system of rules. The artistic approach with games and its influence on popular culture will 
allow for fewers limitations and a possible new found appreciation for design criticism. 
  
Contemporary video games are currently stuck in this cycle where publishers only really permit games that follow a previously established model which results 
in its being marketed to previously established players and usually only to those players. Putting aside commercial obligations, the video game industry can 
benefit from using other tactics such as authorizing the free distribution of games online and perhaps a proper introduction of game design tools to 
nonprogrammers can reinvent not only video games but other medias as well. As seen from time to time, small exclusive groups end up only creating creative 
stagnation. Smaller budgeted games receive the luxury of being more experimental as they have less to lose and no need to play it as safely as possible to 
ensure a large profitted outcome on investment. Once the game industry is more opened to the public, our society will get to celebrate creative creations. 
Mechanical consequences such as game controllers is a prototype.
  
Different mediums are suited to different kinds of expression. Games communicate quite differently from, lets say, novels. If the idea of a bigger community 
being added onto the people in these established groups, we will be able to witness new paths in these different media forms. Creating more and better material 
will challenge perspective industries creatively. Exploring as a sacrifice will help develop and benefit the art forms future generations will consume as well.
