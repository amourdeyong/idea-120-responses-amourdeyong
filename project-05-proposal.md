# PROJECT 05
- demonstrate semester's worth of work all on one page
- potentially (most likely) through a website
- showcase the work through thumbnails in which are clickable
  - clickable links will allow for viewers to be led to the project
- opting for a more professional look (modern, simplistic, & sleek)
- questions:
  - how to create thumbnails
  - how to fill up page
