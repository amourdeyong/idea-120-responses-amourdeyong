# PROJECT04 PROPOSAL

After examining Project Four's document, I think that I am going to follow up with the dream concept I had going on in Project One. My friends and I often
start our days by texting each other our dreams and then we sorta of take turns interpreting them. My dreams often inspire me in many ways. 
Since it will be interactive for the viewers, I am thinking that at the beginning, they will get to choose their character (I am thinking 4) and the one 
they choose will determine which dream sceniaro they will go follow.

Each of the users or characters will be taken inside a pre-lucid dream meaning the entire experience will seem realistic in a sense of familiarity but 
different in that the surroundings are very "dream" like. I believe this is also popularized as the Alice In Wonderland concept as they share similar 
elements. I think that I want to have an overall or cohesive theme of shadows. As for the four characters, I want to write 4 different stories for them. 
The first one with a plot surrounding flowers, second one on closets, third one at school, and the fourth one on cars. Within each story, there is a way 
things can go "wrong" and the user ends up on the character selection page once again.
