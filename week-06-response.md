# the problems and solutions laid out by Bridle  

In "Something is wrong with the internet", writer James Bridle has a specific vision for what the internet 'should be'. The main argument follows how he believes the system is complicit in the abuse especially towards children, the group he repeatedly claims are the real victims to the internet. Throughout the article, Bridle uses this YouTube subculture that exists and is wildly popular among children. He was able to highlighs the instilled extreme fear in not only children but any other age group viewers accompanied by the level of horror and violence on dislay that is created cue to the knock-off characters and nursery rhymes in disturbing content. He further explains "--frames it as a problem of moderation and legislation. YouTube Kids, an official app which claims to be kid-safe but is quite obviously not, is the problem identified, because it wrongly engenders trust in users." The levels of exploitation of children was also mentioned as children are powerless.

As a reader, I have to agree with Bridle. As a kid growing up, the visual and audio material I was exposed to is extremely different from what my younger brother is consuming nowadays. Like Bridle stated, "Obviously this content is inappropriate, obviously there are bad actors out there, obviously some of these videos should be removed. Obviously too this raises questions of fair use, appropriation, free speech and so on." The issue is that, although as a collective we might agree on the content being put out is an eyesore, we have failed to respond accordingly as we don't fully understand the mechanisms involved which leads us to lack the ability to think of its implications in totality. The example of Bounce Patrol Kids made me question just how out of our hands all these bot like content are. The mystery lies in where the automation starts and ends, who is coming up with the ideas and who is roleplaying them. As a result, the amplification of tropes in popular, human-led channels often guides them down the endless route of repeated content but modified in increasingly outlandish and distorted recombinations. As a society, it seems like it is time to start debating the undoubtedly real effects of film or videogame violence on the younger (and potentially future) generations.
